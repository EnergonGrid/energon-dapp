# ENERGON DApp

This repository contains the user interface for the ENERGON protocol deployed on Flare Mainnet.

The interface surfaces on-chain state. It does not control protocol behavior.

---

## Surfaces

### Mint
The Mint surface allows wallets to mint Energon Cubes.

Eligibility for protocol participation is enforced on-chain.
Minting more than one cube does not increase access and may exclude the wallet from participation.

---

### Dashboard
The Dashboard is an observer surface.

It displays protocol state, including:
- Energon Height
- Eligibility status
- Timing constraints

The Dashboard does not imply rewards and does not provide strategy.

---

### Observer
The Observer is a visual-only surface.

It reflects protocol state without enabling interaction.
It exists to be watched, not optimized.

---

## Canon

Protocol behavior is governed by:
- Whitepaper
- Energon Management Protocol (EMP)

User interfaces do not override protocol rules.
